    "Here is a list of project ideas that you guys can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MNIST Hand-Written Digits Classification\n",
    " - This is a really basic machine learning project, you will classify hand written digits as 1 to 10. \n",
    " - You will make a CNN that will be able to classify the images. \n",
    " - Lastly, you will make a small application that allows you to draw a digit and the system will tell you if you are drawing the digit correctly.\n",
    " - https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-deep-learning-project-handwritten-digit-recognition/\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Salary Predictor\n",
    " - This is a very simple linear regression project where you will attempt to predict someone's salary based on how many years they have worked\n",
    " - You will use a very basic dataset and with that you will create a linear regression model to guess salaries.\n",
    " - https://github.com/SiP-AI-ML/LessonMaterials/blob/master/LinearRegressionProject.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Soccer Winner Predictions\n",
    " - This project is meant to take a soccer team's data and see if they will win games based on their previous statisitcs.\n",
    " - You will learn how to analyze data and statistics in a formatted method to make predictions.\n",
    " - You will learn about machine learning algorithms that can make predictions for winners and losers. \n",
    " - You will learn how to collect data from different websites.\n",
    " - https://github.com/llSourcell/Predicting_Winning_Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stock Price Predictions\n",
    " - Guess the prices of stocks based on the market previously. \n",
    " - You will learn how to use the most up to date data and make predictions\n",
    " - You can use a variety of different algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, or clustering.\n",
    " - This is one of the more easy projects.\n",
    " - https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/predicting-stock-price-machine-learningnd-deep-learning-techniques-python/\n",
    " \n",
    "5. CIFAR-10 Image Classification\n",
    " - This is a similar dataset to the MNIST dataset, but you have to predict which class an image is, and they are not digits. \n",
    " - The images to classify are Airplane, Car, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck\n",
    " - You will build a CNN to classify these images using Keras. \n",
    " - This is a harder task than the MNIST Dataset because the images are more complex and have more going on.\n",
