# Intro to AI Course
Open Sourced Materials for the Intro to AI Course

Summer 2020, June 23 - August 11, 8 classes once every week on Tuesdays 5 PM.

The Intro to AI course is a free course for middle school students to gain a basic understanding of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Throughout 8 weeks, Ayaan Haque and Viraaj Reddi covered various machine learning topics, from the mathematical theory to neural networks to NLP. By open sourcing these materials, we hope that others can begin guiding young students into the field of AI/ML. 

To use the lessons, follow the presentations/notebooks in order, and watch the video associated with the lesson.

**Note:** Weeks 7 and 8 were for individual projects, so the videos aren't provided.
