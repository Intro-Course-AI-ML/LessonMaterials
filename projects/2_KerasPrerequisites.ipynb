    "1.\tKeras is both CPU and GPU compatible. \n",
    "    - If you plan to train on small or simple datasets, then you will most likely be fine solely using your CPU.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, you will need a machine with a GPU, and you will need to install cuDNN (NVIDIA's Deep Neural Network library).\n",
    "2.\tInstall Python.\n",
    "    - I personally recommend installing Anaconda, a Python distribution.\n",
    "    - Currently, Keras is compatible with Python 2.7-3.5.\n",
    "3.\tInstall a backend engine.\n",
    "    - Keras supports either Theano or Tensorflow or CNTK.\n",
    "    - Keras uses TF by default, so if using Theano or CNTK, you will need to change Keras configuration afterwards. \n",
    "    - I have another video in this playlist that explains how to change the backend from Tensorflow to Theano.\n",
    "4.\tInstall Keras.\n",
    "5.\tInstall a Python IDE. \n",
    "    - I prefer working with Jupyter Notebook, a scientific notebook for Python.\n",

    "6.\tInstall HDF5 and h5py to have the ability to save Keras models to disk.\n"
