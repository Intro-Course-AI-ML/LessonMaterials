Our brains has been trained to recognize a variety of patterns differentiating a cat and a dog -- furriness, size, bone structure, etc. We can replicate this same process with neural networks, which are based off the human brain. Specifically, we do so using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can recognize these patterns and differentiate between them. Much like other aspects of neural networks, CNNs are based off human anatomy, specifically the visual cortex of the brain. \n",

A CNN is able to use much less pre-processing compared to other classification algorithms. While a traditional neural network has to hand-determine filters, a CNN is able to learn these filters by itself. \n",
